# Noa Rabin Cohen Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, developed with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.  
The site presents my professional experience and is deployed via **GitHub Pages**.

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** with **TypeScript 5**
- **Vite** for development and build tooling
- **CSS** for styling and layout
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting and deployment
- Built with **Node 20 LTS**

## Development Commands

| Command | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `yarn dev` | Launch the development server |
| `yarn build` | Run type checking and generate a production build |
| `yarn preview` | Serve the production build locally for verification |
| `yarn deploy` | Deploy the production build to GitHub Pages |

## Deployment

Production builds are generated in the `dist/` directory and published to the `gh-pages` branch using the `gh-pages` package.  
The live version of the site is available at [https://noarabincohen.com](https://noarabincohen.com).
